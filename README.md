# Welcome Web Slingers :sunglasses:

Are you ready to learn how to do the *cool* things you see on websites?
- __Buttons!__ They can:
    - They can take you places
    - Turn off the sun (on your website)
    - Make pictures *move*
        - Sometimes with __*sound*__ ðŸ˜³
    - Show you things that *weren't even there before*
    - Launch missiles at another sovereign nation
- âœ¨ __*Fancy*__ âœ¨ Backgrounds
- Integrate API's & Web Services into a website
    - __*Note:*__ API/Web Service, & WebApp Construction will likely be part of a separate repo that I'll be setting up specifically for...
        - Angular & React JS
        - Python API Framework
        - REST-ful API Architecture
        - PHP-based SQL/MySQL/PostgreSQL API's

You better be, because I'm not even finished with that list yet.
